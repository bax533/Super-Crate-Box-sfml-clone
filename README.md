# Super-Crate-Box-sfml-clone
my Super Crate box clone written in c++ sfml library

on linux:
  -you have to have sfml library installed, then just compile the game with make
	
	If you want to edit map open the editor just like the game
	you pick the block and put it on map with left mouse button.
	Every floor block should be ended with small wall with arrow facing it.
	example:
	  __
	 |__| |<--
	 	
	Then to save the map click ctrl + s and switch 1.txt file in levels folder with your saved map.
